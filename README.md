## Challenge

### Develop UI to Fetch and Display Contact Form Data

The design is ready and now it needs to be made functional.

The development will be carried out in stages.

In the first two stages, inputs are captured, validated and posted to server.

In the third stage of development, you as a frontend developer have to fetch the data and display it on UI

##### Contact Form

Graffitti Designers have designed contact form that allows app users to provide inputs

#### Challenge

The contact form currently has fields that captures basic contact details.

However, more fields can be added going forward

For a lengthy form, it would not be recommended to display entire details of a contact on the page.

Instead for a cleaner UI, it would be better to display the key details such as name, email and one of the contact nos.

More details can be provided when user opts for it.

Hence, the UI should be accordingly developed and populated.

### Problem Statement

Develop Promise driven HTTP client that uses XMLHttpRequest object to make HTTP calls and returns promise to resolve or reject for the request made to provided url

#### Problem Statement

Fetch the details stored from contacts.json file through json-server

Display the key details, such as 

- FirstName
- LastName
- Email
- Home Contact No

The contact list should be displayed in tabular format as suggested below:

More contact details should be displayed in a modal view, once the + button is clicked, as suggested below.
